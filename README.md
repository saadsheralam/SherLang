## This project is not complete. I am currently working on it and adding more features regularly :). 

### Notes: 
- Language does not work with exponent numbers.
- All internal arithmetic is floating-point to support floating point numbers (this is not the most efficient -- but more convenient, integers and floats can be separated). Hence, the output is also in decimal form.
